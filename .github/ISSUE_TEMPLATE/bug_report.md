You can enclose log files, JSON output from API endpoints and other output in a *code fence* like this:

~~~markdown
```
Code or Log output
```
~~~

This makes it easier to read for the developer (and yourself). You can even add the language used for better formatting:

~~~
```json 
{  
    "employee": {  
        "name":       "sonoo",   
        "salary":      56000,   
        "married":    true  
    }  
}  
```
~~~

will be rendered as 

```json
{  
    "employee": {  
        "name":       "sonoo",   
        "salary":      56000,   
        "married":    true  
    }  
}  
```
